    "faq": {
      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": "How accurate are the AI-generated reports?",
      "a1": "Using Claude AI, reports are generated in natural language based on the content of your lesson notes. You can also edit the reports after generation, so you can adjust them to match your style.",
      "q2": "Do parents need to install an app?",
      "a2": "No, they don't. Parents/guardians can simply log in from their browser to view reports and check learning progress. It works on smartphones, tablets, and PCs.",
      "q3": "What happens when the free trial period ends?",
      "a3": "You will be automatically transitioned to the Standard plan. If you cancel from the dashboard during the trial period, you will not be charged at all. After cancellation, the Free plan (2 students, 5 AI reports/month) remains available.",
      "q4": "Is my data secure?",
      "a4": "With Supabase (PostgreSQL) Row Level Security, each user can only access their own data. All communications are encrypted with HTTPS. Payment information is managed by Stripe — no card data is ever stored on EdBrio.",
      "q5": "Can I use the Free plan indefinitely?",
      "a5": "Yes, there is no time limit on the Free plan. You can continue using it for free as long as you stay within the 2 student and 5 AI reports per month limits.",
      "q6": "Can I use EdBrio without the payment (ticket) feature?",
      "a6": "Absolutely. AI reports, student portfolios, calendar, and other features are all available without Stripe payment integration. The payment feature is entirely optional.",
      "q7": "Can a parent connect with multiple instructors?",
      "a7": "Yes, a parent/guardian account can be linked to multiple instructors. You can manage all your child's reports and bookings from different tutors in one place.",
      "q8": "Can I use it on my phone only?",
      "a8": "Yes, EdBrio is a responsive web app. You can access all features from your smartphone's browser. No app installation is required."
